# music-box

A mechanical music box works by turning a crank so that portrusions of a metal cylinder get caught on holes in a piece of paper. When caught, a string is hit and plays a note. Therefore, in order to customize the songs that a music box plays, a customized sheet of paper must be fed into it so that the portrusions get caught according to the notes of the song.

Online, there aren't many templates for such sheets to feed into a music box. Because of these limited options, I decided to create a website using Spotify's API where any song on spotify can be uploaded in order to retrieve the song that can be fed into a music box.

# what i'm still working on

This is still a work in progress! I'm working on making the Spotify authorization universal (for any spotify user and not just me), and use the search query so that instead of getting the spotify-unique song ID for a song, the user can just search the song and artist and get the music box sheet.
